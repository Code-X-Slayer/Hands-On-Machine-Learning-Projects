# Hands-On Machine Learning: Implementation & Learning Journey

This repository showcases my progress and practical implementation of Machine Learning projects, following the curriculum of the highly-regarded book:

**"Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras & TensorFlow: Concepts, Tools, and Techniques to Build Intelligent Systems"** by **Aurélien Géron**.

## Project Overview

The current focus is on **Part I: The Fundamentals of Machine Learning**, specifically the realization of an end-to-end Machine Learning project.

### 🏠 California Housing Price Prediction (Chapter 2)
In this project, I implement a multivariate regression model to predict median housing prices in California districts.

- **Technical Engineering Documentation**: [end_to_end_ml_project.md](https://github.com/Code-X-Slayer/Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/end_to_end_ml_project.md)
- **Library & Syntax Reference**: [syntax_reference.md](https://github.com/Code-X-Slayer/Hands-On-Machine-Learning-Projects/blob/main/syntax_reference.md)

## Attribution & Credits

This work is based on the examples and techniques provided in Aurélien Géron's book. To ensure a solid grasp of the concepts, my implementation mirrors the book's structure and variable naming conventions where appropriate.

**All credit for the original concepts, datasets, and codebase design goes to Aurélien Géron.**

I am deeply grateful for the clarity and depth of the author's work, which has been instrumental in my learning journey.

## Learning Objectives

- Mastering the full Machine Learning lifecycle from problem framing to deployment.
- Understanding the engineering rationale behind data preprocessing (Imputation, One-Hot Encoding, Scaling).
- Implementing reproducible data transformation pipelines using Scikit-Learn.
- Developing intuition for Bias-Variance trade-offs and Cross-Validation.
